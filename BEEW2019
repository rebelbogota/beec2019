### Bogotá Experimental Economics Workshop 2019
# January 8-10, 2019, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia

The Rosario Experimental and Behavioral Economics Lab (REBEL), with the generous support from IFREE and Universidad del Rosario
is pleased to announce the second edition of the Bogotá Experimental Economics Workshop (BEEW), 
which will be held on January 8 to 10, 2019. 

Following the workshop, we will host the Bogotá Experimental Economics Conference (January 10 to 12).

The aim of the Workshop is to expand research tools by providing theoretical background and 
hands-on training on areas related to experimental economics research. 
It will concentrate on two modules: experimetrics (the econometric analysis of experimental data), 
and tools and practical steps to make your research more transparent, reliable and credible, 
while contributing to make science more open and reproducible.

The lead instructor for the workshop will be Professor Peter Moffat (University of East Anglia). 
Prof. Moffat will lead the module on experimetrics. 
In addition, a team of BITSS catalysts will lead the module on methods to improve openness, 
transparency and replicability in experimental economics research (including hands on training on power analysis, 
pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, version control and dynamic documents). 

We invite applications from graduate students and young scholars interested in experimental methods in the social sciences. 
We especially encourage applications from scholars from (or interested in doing research in) Latin America, 
as one of the main aims of this event is to strengthen the ties within the Latin American experimental economics 
community and the rest of the world. 

Important Dates
Submission Deadline – October 24th Notification of Acceptance – October 29th Early Registration – November 27th
