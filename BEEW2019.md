# Bogotá Experimental Economics Workshop 2019
## January 8-10, 2019, Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia

The Rosario Experimental and Behavioral Economics Lab (REBEL), with the generous support from 
<a href="http://ifreeweb.org/" target="_blank"> IFREE </a> 
and <a href="http://www.urosario.edu.co/Facultad-de-Economia/Inicio/" target="_blank"> Universidad del Rosario</a> 
will host the second edition of the Bogotá Experimental Economics Workshop - BEEW, on January 8 to 10, 2019. 

Following the workshop, we will host the [Bogotá Experimental Economics Conference - BEEC](index) (January 10 to 12).

The aim of the Workshop is to expand research tools by providing theoretical background and 
hands-on training on areas related to experimental economics research. The workshop will concentrate on two modules: 

- **Experimetrics:** the econometric analysis of experimental data. The lead instructor will be Professor Peter Moffat (University of East Anglia).  
- **Openness, transparency and replicability in experimental economics research.** The module will be led by a team of <a href="https://www.bitss.org/" target="_blank"> BITSS </a> (Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences) catalysts. It includes hands on training on power analysis, 
pre-registration and pre-analysis plans, version control and dynamic documents

We invite <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/MkS95HDaSCRk70ny1" target="_blank"> applications </a> from graduate students and young scholars interested in experimental methods in the social sciences. 

We especially encourage applications from scholars from (or interested in doing research in) Latin America, 
as one of the main aims of this event is to strengthen the ties within the Latin American experimental economics 
community and the rest of the world.
